<h1>Virtual Lab Development using RaphaelJS</h1>

<h5>Web Application that makes learning for weak students easier, by using visual aids. This app is focused on networking algorithms NAT and ARP.</h5>

-----------------------------------------

### Motivation, Challenge & Accomplishment

* **Motivation:** Looking for a project/internship that adds value, we found out about the 'Virtual Lab' project at our college that was aimed at using visual aids to make
learning and understanding concepts easier.
* **Challenge:** Gaining an indepth understanding of JavaScript and any associated animation framework. On the deliverable side, we were challenged to cover as many of the networking algorithms as we could in the limited time that we had. 
* **Accomplishment:** Notwithstanding some interface errors, we successfully deployed functionally correct animations for two of the networking algorithms - NAT and ARP.

### Tech Stack
* JavaScript
* RaphaelJS Animation Framework
* HTML5
* CSS3

### Features

- `NAT`: A simple scenario of packet transfer from a private IP to a public IP through one router. User can see packet details at each step.
- `ARP`: We take the scenario of exchange of ARP packets within the same network. The application shows the ARP reply and request packets as well as the IP packets with their contents at each stage. It also lets the user guess which IP is mapped to which MAC address, aiding in learning.
