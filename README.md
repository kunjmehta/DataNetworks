  <h5>Web Application that makes learning for weak students easier, by using visual aids. This app is focused on networking algorithms NAT and ARP</h5>

</div>

-----------------------------------------

### Features

- `NAT`: A simple scenario of packet transfer from a private IP to a public IP through one router. User can see packet details at each step.
- `ARP`: We take the scenario of exchange of ARP packets within the same network. The application shows the ARP reply and request packets as well as the IP packets with their contents at each stage. It also lets the user guess which IP is mapped to which MAC address, aiding in learning.
